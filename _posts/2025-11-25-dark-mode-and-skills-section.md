## Major Website Updates

Today I implemented some significant improvements to the portfolio website, focusing on user experience and better showcasing my technical skills.

### Dark Mode Toggle 🌙

Added a fully functional dark mode toggle to the navigation bar. The theme preference is saved in your browser's localStorage, so it remembers your choice between visits. The implementation includes:

- Smooth transitions between light and dark themes
- Custom color variables for easy theme management
- All sections, cards, and modals adapt seamlessly
- A rotating moon/sun icon that makes the toggle satisfying to click

### Skills & Technologies Section 📊

Replaced the old "Various Connections" section with a brand new Skills section that visually represents my experience with different programming languages and technologies. Features include:

- **Animated progress bars** that fill in when you scroll to the section
- **Project count indicators** showing concrete experience (e.g., "15+ projects")
- **Visual hierarchy** making it easy to see which technologies I'm most proficient with
- **Icons for each language** (Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS, Git)

The bars are customizable and currently use placeholder values that I'll update to reflect my actual project experience.

### Streamlined Contact Section

Consolidated all contact methods into a single, clean section titled "Connect With Me". All four contact options (phone, email, GitHub, LinkedIn) now use the same circular icon design with consistent hover effects:

- Icons lift up on hover
- Orange highlight color for visual feedback
- Tooltips showing additional info
- Clean, modern aesthetic

### Other Improvements

- Removed the incomplete FAQ page button
- Updated navigation to reflect new sections
- Improved responsive design for mobile devices
- Added custom CSS and JavaScript files for better code organization

All changes are live on the site now. The dark mode is my favorite addition - it's great for late-night portfolio browsing!

### Technical Stack

These improvements were built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, keeping the site lightweight and fast. No additional frameworks needed!
